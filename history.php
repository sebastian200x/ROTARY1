            <p>The Rotary E-club of All Star CAMANAVA sponsored by Rotary Club of Malabon East is a non-profit
                organization in the Philippines. It was planned and developed with a vision of helping the community
                by achieving the motto of Rotary International “Service Above Self”. The Club was chartered on April
                5, 2023 with 20 charter members headed by Charter President Jacil Maris Luma-as.
                It was on October 27, 2022 when the talk about the chartering of the new club had started and
                scheduled a provisionary meeting to prepare and educate new members about the rotary. The first
                virtual meeting of the club happened on November 4, 2022 via zoom. Gov. Tonipi Paruñgao was informed
                about the approval of RC Navotas namely SAG Ross Morales, AG Richard Lucas and IATP Romy Padua to
                officially transfer 5 members from the Rotary E-club of Navotas to the new E-Club.
                The first engagement of the Charter President Jacil Maris “Jaja” Luma-as was on November 11, 2022
                when she attended the RYLA as one of the Rylians facilitators. By November 14, 2022 the board
                resolution was finally signed and notarized and the requirements needed were forwarded. On the 13th
                of December PP Jed Concepcion of Rotary Club of Malabon East was confirmed as the New Club Adviser
                by then District Governor Arturo Bobby Tanyag.</p>

            <p>The club conducted its chartering presentation, first governor’s visit and induction ceremony on May
                21, 2023 at Rotary Club of Malabon East Training Center. Only one month after the induction, the
                members had their general assembly and strategic planning in Bed, Bark and Breakfast managed by
                Animal Kingdom Foundation.
                Way before the club officially started, the members already participated in various events,
                activities and even launched some projects particularly in women’s empowerment and disease
                prevention.
                On July 1 the Rotary E-club of All Star CAMANAVA charged and welcomed its new members which shared
                the same passion and commitment with the charter members, this was headed by the new club president
                HCP. Jemuel Pilapil. It was also in July when an SAG and AG visit happened wherein planned projects
                were presented, it was attended personally by some members while others attended through zoom.
                Last August 3, 2023 the club conducted its induction ceremony together with its sponsoring club the
                Rotary Club of Malabon East at Quezon City Sports Club, it was then the new set of officers were
